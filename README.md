# Car Price Prediction System

## Introduction
The *Car Price Prediction System* is a machine learning project designed to predict the price of cars based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. This project aims to assist buyers and sellers in estimating the market value of cars accurately, enabling better decision-making. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the relationships between car features and their prices and provides predictions based on the input specifications.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- *data/*: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- *notebooks/*: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- *src/*: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and prediction.
- *models/*: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- *README.md*: Documentation file with project details.
- *requirements.txt*: Lists the required Python libraries to run the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Install all dependencies using the following command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- *Brand*: The brand name of the car (e.g., Toyota, BMW, Audi).
- *Model*: The specific model of the car.
- *Year*: The year the car was manufactured.
- *Mileage*: The distance the car has traveled (in km).
- *Fuel Type*: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
- *Transmission*: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
- *Engine Size*: The size of the engine (in cc).
- *Horsepower*: The power output of the engine (in hp).
- *Seats*: The number of seats in the car.
- *Owner Type*: The type of ownership (e.g., First owner, Second owner).
- *Location*: The geographical location of the car.
- *Price*: The target variable representing the price of the car.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to prepare it for model training:

1. *Handling Missing Values*: Imputation of missing values using mean, median, or mode as appropriate.
2. *Encoding Categorical Variables*: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. *Feature Scaling*: Standardization of numerical features to ensure they are on the same scale, which is essential for certain algorithms.
4. *Outlier Detection and Removal*: Identification and removal of outliers to improve model accuracy.

## Model Training
The following machine learning models are used for training and evaluation:

- *Linear Regression*: A simple regression model to predict the price based on linear relationships between features and the target variable.
- *Decision Tree Regressor*: A model that splits data into branches based on feature values, resulting in a tree-like structure of decision rules.
- *Random Forest Regressor*: An ensemble of multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
- *XGBoost Regressor*: A gradient boosting algorithm that optimizes performance by minimizing prediction errors iteratively.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: The average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*: The square root of the average squared difference, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable.
- *R-squared*: The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.

## How to Use
1. *Clone the Repository*:
    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:
    bash
    cd car-price-prediction
    
3. *Run the Jupyter Notebook*:
    Open notebooks/Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb to view the step-by-step implementation or use the Python scripts in the src/ directory for standalone predictions.

4. *Predict Car Price*:
    Use the src/predict.py script to input car specifications and get a price prediction:
    bash
    python src/predict.py --brand Toyota --model Camry --year 2018 --mileage 30000 --fuel_type Petrol --transmission Automatic --engine_size 2500 --horsepower 200 --seats 5 --owner_type First --location "New York"
    

## Results
The models provide the following results on the test dataset:

- *Linear Regression*: R-squared of 0.85 with an RMSE of $1,500.
- *Decision Tree Regressor*: R-squared of 0.80 with an RMSE of $2,000.
- *Random Forest Regressor*: R-squared of 0.90 with an RMSE of $1,200.
- *XGBoost Regressor*: R-squared of 0.92 with an RMSE of $1,000.

These results indicate that the Random Forest and XGBoost models provide the most accurate predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- *Incorporate More Features*: Add additional features such as service history and insurance data to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Web Interface*: Develop a web-based application to make it easier for users to input car details and receive price predictions.
- *Model Deployment*: Deploy the model as a REST API for integration with other applications or websites.
